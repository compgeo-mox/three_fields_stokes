# Abstract
We propose a mixed finite element method for Stokes flow with one degree of freedom per element and facet of simplicial grids. The method is derived by considering the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation and eliminating the vorticity locally through the use of a quadrature rule. The discrete solution is pointwise divergence-free and the method is pressure robust. The theoretically derived convergence rates are confirmed by numerical experiments.
